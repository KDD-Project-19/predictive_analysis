**Covid-19 :  Trend of spread of covid with increasing vaccination** 

This project is part of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ITCS - 6162) course from University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

Project Status: On Progress

**INTRODUCTION:**

**Project Domain:**

Pandemic, Disease(Covid-19)

**Project Proposal:**

Covid-19 is a contagious disease that became a pandemic in 2020 mainly spreading through close contact with the infected person. Our objective here is to do descriptive analysis on a merged daily data of Belgium people for all age groups. Correlations will be examined between positive cases, hospitalizations,vaccinations and death rate. Based on the knowledge, a linear regression model will be used to predict the progression of the disease as vaccinations increase with accuracy.

**INTRODUCTION TO DATASET:**

We are working on the Covid-19 data of belgium. The dataset contains data from the beginning of covid i.e, from march 2020 to september 2021.

**The Dataset Contains the Following Predictors:**

DATE-  The dates of positive cases, deaths, vaccinations taken

NR_REPORTING- Number of hospitals reporting

TOTAL_IN- Total number of patients hospitalized due to covid-19 at the time of reporting

TOTAL_IN_ICU- Total number of patients in the ICU due to covid-19 at the time of reporting

TOTAL_IN_RESP- Total number of patients under respiratory support due to covid-19 at the time of reporting

TOTAL_IN_ECMO- Total number of patients on ECMO due to covid-19 at the time of reporting

NEW_IN- Number of patients hospitalized in the past 24 hours due to covid-19

NEW_OUT- Number of patients discharged in the past 24 hours cured from covid-19

TESTS_ALL- Total number of performed tests

TESTS_ALL_POS- Total number of positive tests

DEATHS- Total number of deaths due to covid-19

COUNT- Number of people receiving the covid-19 vaccine

REGION_CATEG- Region of residence of positive cases, vaccine taken, death, hospitalized

BRAND_CATEG- Vaccines brands which are nationally authorized or included in the WHO listings

DOSE_CATEG- Dose identifier (for vaccines requiring 2 doses: A for first dose, B for second dose; C for vaccine requiring only 1 dose; E for extra dose of vaccine if needed)

**INSTALLATION:**

Anaconda 4.10.1. Distribution

Python 3.9.5 

Jupyter Notebook

**CRISP-DM PROCESS:**

The Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a six-phase process model that describes the data science lifecycle.It's like a set of guardrails that assist you to arrange, organize, and execute your data science (or machine learning) ventures.
The six major phases of CRISP-DM process are:

Business understanding 

Data understanding 

Data preparation

Modeling 

Evaluation 

Deployment 
 
**Business Understanding:**

The beginning of every project is to understand the problem statement and figure out what we need to accomplish. We must first specify the objectives of our problem statements and identify the requirements, hence transforming them into a data mining problem definition.

Our target population is the General public, Community members, Healthcare workers, and Vulnerable populations. Using the regional day-to-day covid-19 data from Belgium about the number of positive cases, Hospital details, mortality rate and, Vaccination data, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the merged data. A linear regression model will help us predict the number of positive cases based on the increase in vaccination rate with accuracy.
 
**Data Understanding:**

The main goal of this deliverable was to perform descriptive analysis on regional covid-19 data from Belgium by preparing and preprocessing the dataset, merging different datasets, and performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the combined dataset, which included comparing data such as the number of covid cases in different regions and the number of vaccines administered in each region. After preprocessing our data for modeling, the next step would be to do predictive analysis on the dataset by using linear regression to accurately forecast the number of positive cases based on the rise in vaccination rate.

**Data Preparation:**

Our dataset was of four different entities consisting of the number of positive cases, mortality rate, hospital details, vaccination details, which needed to be merged to form a useable single dataset.
Handling missing values:
On merging the datasets, we found a lot of empty data in our dataset which needs to be handled to get an efficient dataset, so we assigned NA values and 0 to the data, depending on its requirement. 

**Cleaning Data:**

On merging the dataset, we found a few duplicate data and unwanted columns of data, so we cleaned the data by dropping the unwanted rows and columns.
Categorical Data Conversion:
Our dataset consists of a few object data types which need to be converted into categorical data for further EDA and Predicting purposes. So, the data columns like REGION, BRAND, and DOSE were converted into categorical data.

**Standardising Data:**

The dataset had values varying from a high range and were in a need for standardising. So, the data would be standardized using StandardScaler.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**

Exploratory Data Analysis has been performed on the dataset showing relation to domain and problem statement. Visualization of the dataset has been done by plotting several graphs helping us to find the relationship between the dataâ€™s present in the dataset and to analyse the dataset for a better understanding.
