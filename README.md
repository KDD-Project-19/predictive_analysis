# Covid-19 :  Trend of spread of covid with increasing vaccination. 

This project is part of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ITCS - 6162) course from University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
Project Status: On Progress

## INTRODUCTION:

### Project Domain: 

Pandemic, Disease(Covid-19)

## Project Proposal:

Covid-19 is a contagious disease that became a pandemic in 2020 mainly spreading through close contact with the infected person. Our objective here is to do descriptive analysis on a merged daily data of Belgium people for all age groups. Correlations will be examined between positive cases, hospitalizations,vaccinations and death rate. Based on the knowledge, a linear regression model will be used to predict the progression of the disease as vaccinations increase with accuracy.

### Research Questions:

The target population: General public, Community members, Healthcare workers, and  Vulnerable populations can use the analysis made out of this project.

Whether your research is descriptive (EDA) or analytic: Descriptive Using the regional covid -19 data from Belgium for all age groups, descriptive analysis will be performed on the merged data and a linear regression model would be used to predict the number of positive cases based on the increase in vaccination rate with accuracy.
If the question is original or you are using other research as a base (be sure to give credit): The analysis that is being carried out is original neither based on any other research nor an enhancement of analysis that is made.

The data that you are using: The data sets we collected are the unlabelled datasets from https://www.belgium.be/en website which has relevant regional daily data from March, 2020 till Sep, 2021 for all the age groups.

Outcome of the Predictive analysis: The outcome trend is expected to have a decreased number of cases with the increase in vaccination rates.
